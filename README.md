# Linear_Regression_Model
This project predicts the demand for shared bikes using multiple linear regression. It covers the complete end-to-end process  from data understanding and cleaning to model building, feature selection, and validation.

## General Information
- This project focuses on building a multiple linear regression model to understand how different factors affect the demand for shared bikes.
- The dataset contains information such as season, weather, temperature, humidity, and windspeed, along with the total number of bikes rented per day.
- The main goal is to identify key variables that influence bike demand and build a model that can accurately predict it.
- Business Problem: A bike-sharing company wants to plan operations, manage inventory, and predict future demand based on environmental and time-based patterns.
- Dataset: The dataset used is the Bike Sharing dataset, which includes both categorical and numerical features.

## Conclusions
- Temperature has the strongest positive impact on bike demand — warmer weather encourages more people to use bikes.
- Weather conditions, especially light rain or mist, significantly reduce bike demand.
- Year shows a positive correlation, indicating that demand increased in the following year due to rising popularity or better awareness.
- Spring season and high windspeed tend to lower bike demand slightly.
- The final model achieved with 6 varibales and R² of around 79%, showing a strong fit and reliable predictive power.
